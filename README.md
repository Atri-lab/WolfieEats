# WolfieEats

WolfieEats is on a mission to revolutionize the dining experience at Stony Brook University by providing a one-stop solution to all dining hall needs. This app is designed to tackle common issues like long wait times and limited meal planning capabilities, streamlining the process with technology.

## Features

- **Active Queue Management**: Allows users to join and view active queues at dining locations, offering real-time updates on wait times. The approximate wait time is dynamically calculated based on four key factors: the number of staff working, the current queue length, average transaction time, and the estimated cooking time for food. This ensures that users receive accurate wait times to plan their meals more efficiently.
- **Order Ahead**: Browse through the menu, place orders in advance, and skip the queue. This feature simplifies meal ordering, making it more convenient and time-efficient.
- **Nutritional Information**: Each menu item comes with detailed nutritional information, allowing users to make informed choices based on their dietary needs.
- **Customizable Filters**: Users can search and filter menu items based on specific dietary preferences such as carbs, protein, calories, sugar, and fats, offering a personalized dining experience.
- **Comprehensive Reviews**: Users can read and write reviews for different dining locations, fostering a community-driven approach to improve dining services.
- **Operating Hours**: Displays the active hours of various dining locations, making it easier for users to plan their visits.
- **Search and Navigation**: Enhanced search functionality and intuitive navigation help users quickly find exactly what they are looking for.

### Special Requirements

- **Join the Queue Feature**: To utilize the 'Join the Queue' feature, a physical device with a camera is required. This feature uses the device's camera to scan QR codes for queue management, making it unsuitable for use on simulators.
